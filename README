NAME
    URI::duri - the duri URI scheme

SYNOPSIS
     my $uri = URI->new('duri:2012:http://tobyinkster.co.uk/');
     say $uri->embedded_uri;

DESCRIPTION
    The dated URI scheme is defined in an Internet Draft
    <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-masinter-dated-uri-10>. Dated URIs
    include a date and an embedded URI. They identify the same resource that
    was identified by the embedded URI at the given date.

    This module brings support for the duri URI scheme to the URI framework.

  Constructor
    The constructor can be called in two forms:

    `new($string)`
    `new(\%hash)`

    When called with a string argument, must be a URI string conforming to the
    dated URI Internet Draft.

    If called with a hashref argument, the hash must have a key `embedded_uri`
    which is a string or URI object. It may have a key `datetime_string` which
    is a string representing a datetime in the format required by the dated
    URI specification; alternatively it may have a key `datetime` which is a
    DateTime or (better) DateTime::Incomplete object; if neither are present,
    then the current time is used instead.

  Methods
    The following accessors are provided:

    `datetime`
    `datetime($object)`
        Get/set the URI's datetime as a DateTime::Incomplete object.

    `datetime_string`
    `datetime_string($string)`
        Get/set the URI's datetime as a literal string.

    `embedded_uri`
    `embedded_uri($uri)`
        Get/set the embedded URI as a URI object. (The setter may also be
        called with a plain string.)

    The following methods are inherited from URI and make sense to use:

    `scheme`
    `scheme($string)`
        Get/set the URI scheme.

    `as_string`
        Get the URI as a string.

    `as_iri`
        Get the URI as a Unicode string.

    `canonical`
        Get the URI as a canonical string.

    `secure`
        Returns false, though the method doesn't make much sense. One URI is
        no more secure than another; it is protocols that can be secure or
        insecure.

    `eq($uri)`
        Tests if this URI is equal to another.

    The following methods are also inherited from URI, but don't make much
    sense to use: `opaque`, `path`, `fragment`. It generally makes more sense
    to inspect the embedded URI:

     say $duri->embedded_uri->fragment;
